<h2><u>Interests in IT</u>  </h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Background story to IT:</b>
    <p>
      As it is shown in my education section, I am one of those non-traditional students who switch majors after realising that the current path is no longer suitable for them.
    As a kid growing up in a somewhat conventional Vietnamese family, its culture has been nurturing my mindset that there are specific fields/industries that females should not attempt to enter for undeniable reasons ,
    one of them is obviously Computer Science/ Information Technology. Therefore, after highschool, my options consisted of plenty of majors, yet none of them is a IT-related one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I picked Biotechnology with the hope of working as a scientist in laboratories, or as a bioinformatician who analyses Biotech-focused information. However, commencing a course only with a love
      for it is not sufficient by any mean. Biotechnology, or Biology in general, is an undeniably great field which has a thick history of centuries and a massive foundation with many generations contributed to it.
      The knowledge one can gain from it is also very practical and interesting since nature and human's body are still a mysterious treasure waiting for us to discover. However, the problem of modern biology for students is
      that it comprises of mostly passive learning and theoretical-based knowledge. Hence, one may have to spend years obtaining existing knowledge before he/she can stand on their own feets. I was naive enough to not be able to
      detect that those learning patterns does not fit my personality - which constantly seeks for innovative ideas and creative knowleadge.
    </p>
  <li><b>The Turning Point:</b>
    <p>
    Later on I did meet someone who gave me an opportunity to try messing around with technology and that was the turning point for my whole academic pathway. By that moment, Technology instantly became the most fascinating thing
    I have ever bumped into. No doubts how has it been accelerating in the past few decades despite being a relatively new field. Day by day, the impacts technology puts on our lives are so apparent regardless of any circumstances.
    It was so dazzling that I got inspired to start doing my own research every single days as well as teaching myslef a programming language. Problem-solving had been such a faint thing that I barely cared about until I tried it for real.
    Particularly, I attempted solving the puzzles on <a href=" https://projecteuler.net/"> Euler Project, <a href= " https://www.codewars.com/">Code Wars</a>, took some courses on <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/"> Udemy</a> and some other open-source courses. After that I decided that I would love
    to pursue a degree in order to get feet into a professional career path and switched my major to IT.
  </p>
  <p>
     The person who inspired me into IT is someone that has life-changing impacts on me, those include but not limited to IT. To cut a long story short, he is an experienced talented software engineer who has been working everywhere in the world,
     including the famous Silicon Valley. Being a foreigner and an open-minded person who also supports gender balance in the field, he supported me both physically and mentally. Hence, he is apparently considered a mentor to me. There are problems
     that students like us usually bumped into and get stuck, having a mentor is possibly a shortcut to the solutions as he/she may have been through those problems and usually can give us advice.
   </p>
 <li><b> Experience:</b>
   <p>
   I am currently supporting the Mobile App QA team at <a href = "https://www.skedulo.com/"> Skedulo</a> (Vietnam Office) as an intern. My responsiblity consists testing the beta product of the company, writing test cases regarding app's functions and reporting issues to Dev team.
   On daily basis, I got to know the practical organisational structure of a Tech company and general work flow of a creating a tech product.
</p>
 </li>
 <br>
<li>
  <b>Why RMIT??</b><p>
    The reasons I selected RMIT for the degree are also commonsenses. First and foremost, it has such a huge global connection which would potentially leads to international opportunities for any students of any majors.
    This is the upside that other conventional universities/college may not have, if any, very limited ones. Secondly, RMIT is known for its open culture and flexible, time-efficient entry requirements,
    thereby, it is not complicated for a non-traditional student like myself to be eligible, and the whole application process was done via email exchanges. Lastly, the facilities we have at RMIT is very promising that it would support every individual
    to do anything at their best.
  </p></li>
  <li><b>Academic Expectation from the degree:</b><p>
    Since RMIT is a Applied-science school which would teach students practical knowledge during there journey here, prior to attending school, I expected to gain and practice applicable knowledge into solving current shortcomings in the society. My anticipation has
    not been changed now that I have been studying at RMIT . Every courses have been very straightforward, materials are state-of-the-art and structure is effective.
  </p></li>

   <h2><u>Below are all the positions that I may be interested in working as my future career:</u></h2>
 <break>
   <p>
  <ol>
    <li><b><u>UI/UX/CX design</u></b>
      <figure>
        <img src="C:\Users\MOON CACTUS\Desktop\my coding self taught path\Intro to IT\Images\Screenshot (3).png" height = 90% width = 90% >
        <figcaption> <i>UX/UI designer position- MAPLE LABS- <a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/ux-ui-designer-mobile-apps-maple-labs-0427">IT Viec</a></i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The position caught my interest as I am a visual thinker, therby, any front-end positions could potentially be a good match.
        A UI/UX designer's typical day includes converting user's visual expectations into what will be displayed on the product and work closely with other teams
        in order to deliver a desirable result. Besides, I picked this specific position over others is because the company is a startup, which means there is a chance that
        I will be able to learn in an innovative, dynamic, though risky environment. In which will nurture my adaptability for change and flexibility. Also, since startup usually
        seek for integraties and values over fixed obligations, their working culture is possibly very different in a positive way.
        <br>
        <br>
        From my research, beside having an computer science-related degree, a good candidate for the position needs to be creative and is an open-minded person when
        it comes to designing a graphical product. Moreover, the person also obligated to be effective at communication as their responsibility is associated with
        plenty of conversations, from professional-based, internal ones to commercial ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I do not own any required qualifications or relevant experience, yet I am on my way of achieving an IT degree at RMIT Vietnam. Additionally, I
        do study by myself using available open-source courses online.
        <br>
        <br>
        Particularly, I'm putting my focus mainly into some specific programming languages(e.g Python, Javascript), libraries, frameworks that are commonly used for UX/UI development. Additionally,
        I'm seeking experience in professional technology environment in order to improve my soft skills and get used to the general workflows of creating a product.
        For example, being a tester intern at <a href="https://skedulo.com"> Skedulo Company</a> is giving me not only information related to my current interest but also to other
        subjects as well. With that being said, it is ideal for me to verify if my mindset, personality, expectations fit the role or should I consider other directions.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li><b><u>Quality control/assurance</u></b>
      <figure>

       </figure>
    <p>
      From my perspectives, Quality Control/Assurance is indeed a fantastic area that many engineering graduates overlook. However, QA/QC is a ciritical step in the process of product development
      since "quality is not an option, it is a must."- Jeremy Mullaly, Skedulo engineering manager. The job of finding and fixing the product's bugs will not only prevent the potentially bad  in the user's experience,
      but it also help the company to reduce significant fanancial loss to fixable errors. Sometime, software bugs can lead to fatal situations in which the consequenses are irreversible. For instance,
      "Between 1985 and 1987, at least 5 patients were killed (and others critically injured) when a software-controlled radiation therapy system, the Therac-25, inadvertently administered massive
      overdoses of radiation — over 100 times the prescribed dose." <a href = "https://medium.com/swlh/when-software-kills-ab6f48a15825"> <i>When Software Kills</i></a>, Keri Savoca, Medium.com.
      <br>
      <br>
      Apparently, I have not pursued any sort of qualifications that make me eligible for an actual QA/QC engineer position at a company, I'm working towards the goals set ahead. Specifically, in addition
      to taking courses at RMIT, I am trained to work alongside with a QC team in Brisbane city and we are aiming stability for Skedulo Mobile Application in a foreseeable future.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since there is open source code for Automation Software Tests everywhere on the Internet, it is very accessible if we want to take advantage of that available precious information.
      Also, I'm currently have authorisation to look at internal test cases QC engineers at Skedulo wrote for the product, it is obviously a valuable opportunity to collect, both the technical
      and procedural knowledge.
