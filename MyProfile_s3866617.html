</p>
<h2><u>Interests in IT</u>  </h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Background story to IT:</b>
    <p>
      As it is shown in my education section, I am one of those non-traditional students who switch majors after realising that the current path is no longer suitable for them.
    As a kid growing up in a somewhat conventional Vietnamese family, its culture has been nurturing my mindset that there are specific fields/industries that females should not attempt to enter for undeniable reasons ,
    one of them is obviously Computer Science/ Information Technology. Therefore, after highschool, my options consisted of plenty of majors, yet none of them is a IT-related one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I picked Biotechnology with the hope of working as a scientist in laboratories, or as a bioinformatician who analyses Biotech-focused information. However, commencing a course only with a love
      for it is not sufficient by any mean. Biotechnology, or Biology in general, is an undeniably great field which has a thick history of centuries and a massive foundation with many generations contributed to it.
      The knowledge one can gain from it is also very practical and interesting since nature and human's body are still a mysterious treasure waiting for us to discover. However, the problem of modern biology for students is
      that it comprises of mostly passive learning and theoretical-based knowledge. Hence, one may have to spend years obtaining existing knowledge before he/she can stand on their own feets. I was naive enough to not be able to
      detect that those learning patterns does not fit my personality - which constantly seeks for innovative ideas and creative knowleadge.
    </p>
  <li><b>The Turning Point:</b>
    <p>
    Later on I did meet someone who gave me an opportunity to try messing around with technology and that was the turning point for my whole academic pathway. By that moment, Technology instantly became the most fascinating thing
    I have ever bumped into. No doubts how has it been accelerating in the past few decades despite being a relatively new field. Day by day, the impacts technology puts on our lives are so apparent regardless of any circumstances.
    It was so dazzling that I got inspired to start doing my own research every single days as well as teaching myslef a programming language. Problem-solving had been such a faint thing that I barely cared about until I tried it for real.
    Particularly, I attempted solving the puzzles on <a href=" https://projecteuler.net/"> Euler Project, <a href= " https://www.codewars.com/">Code Wars</a>, took some courses on <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/"> Udemy</a> and some other open-source courses. After that I decided that I would love
    to pursue a degree in order to get feet into a professional career path and switched my major to IT.
  </p>
  <p>
     The person who inspired me into IT is someone that has life-changing impacts on me, those include but not limited to IT. To cut a long story short, he is an experienced talented software engineer who has been working everywhere in the world,
     including the famous Silicon Valley. Being a foreigner and an open-minded person who also supports gender balance in the field, he supported me both physically and mentally. Hence, he is apparently considered a mentor to me. There are problems
     that students like us usually bumped into and get stuck, having a mentor is possibly a shortcut to the solutions as he/she may have been through those problems and usually can give us advice.
   </p>
 <li><b> Experience:</b>
   <p>
   I am currently supporting the Mobile App QA team at <a href = "https://www.skedulo.com/"> Skedulo</a> (Vietnam Office) as an intern. My responsiblity consists testing the beta product of the company, writing test cases regarding app's functions and reporting issues to Dev team.
   On daily basis, I got to know the practical organisational structure of a Tech company and general work flow of a creating a tech product.
</p>
 </li>
 <br>
<li>
  <b>Why RMIT??</b><p>
    The reasons I selected RMIT for the degree are also commonsenses. First and foremost, it has such a huge global connection which would potentially leads to international opportunities for any students of any majors.
    This is the upside that other conventional universities/college may not have, if any, very limited ones. Secondly, RMIT is known for its open culture and flexible, time-efficient entry requirements,
    thereby, it is not complicated for a non-traditional student like myself to be eligible, and the whole application process was done via email exchanges. Lastly, the facilities we have at RMIT is very promising that it would support every individual
    to do anything at their best.
  </p></li>
  <li><b>Academic Expectation from the degree:</b><p>
    Since RMIT is a Applied-science school which would teach students practical knowledge during there journey here, prior to attending school, I expected to gain and practice applicable knowledge into solving current shortcomings in the society. My anticipation has
    not been changed now that I have been studying at RMIT . Every courses have been very straightforward, materials are state-of-the-art and structure is effective.
  </p></li>
</ol>
   <h2><u>Below are all the positions that I may be interested in working as my future career:</u></h2>
 <break>
   <p>
  <ol>
    <li><b><u>UI/UX/CX design</u></b>
      <figure>
        <img src="Images/Screenshot (3).png" height = 90% width = 90% >
        <figcaption> <i>UX/UI designer position- MAPLE LABS- <a href="https://itviec.com/it-jobs/ux-ui-designer-mobile-apps-maple-labs-0427">IT Viec</a></i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The position caught my interest as I am a visual thinker, therby, any front-end positions could potentially be a good match.
        A UI/UX designer's typical day includes converting user's visual expectations into what will be displayed on the product and work closely with other teams
        in order to deliver a desirable result. Besides, I picked this specific position over others is because the company is a startup, which means there is a chance that
        I will be able to learn in an innovative, dynamic, though risky environment. In which will nurture my adaptability for change and flexibility. Also, since startup usually
        seek for integraties and values over fixed obligations, their working culture is possibly very different in a positive way.
        <br>
        <br>
        From my research, beside having an computer science-related degree, a good candidate for the position needs to be creative and is an open-minded person when
        it comes to designing a graphical product. Moreover, the person also obligated to be effective at communication as their responsibility is associated with
        plenty of conversations, from professional-based, internal ones to commercial ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I do not own any required qualifications or relevant experience, yet I am on my way of achieving an IT degree at RMIT Vietnam. Additionally, I
        do study by myself using available open-source courses online.
        <br>
        <br>
        Particularly, I'm putting my focus mainly into some specific programming languages(e.g Python, Javascript), libraries, frameworks that are commonly used for UX/UI development. Additionally,
        I'm seeking experience in professional technology environment in order to improve my soft skills and get used to the general workflows of creating a product.
        For example, being a tester intern at <a href="https://skedulo.com"> Skedulo Company</a> is giving me not only information related to my current interest but also to other
        subjects as well. With that being said, it is ideal for me to verify if my mindset, personality, expectations fit the role or should I consider other directions.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li><b><u>Quality control/assurance</u></b>
      <figure>
        <img src ="Images/Screenshot (4).png" width = 90% height = 90%>
        <figcaption> <i>Quality control engineer position- FUEL CLOUD- <a href= "https://itviec.com/it-jobs/senior-quality-control-engineer-tester-fuelcloud-3702"> IT Viec</a> </i></figcaption>
       </figure>
    <p>
      From my perspectives, Quality Control/Assurance is indeed a fantastic area that many engineering graduates overlook. However, QA/QC is a ciritical step in the process of product development
      since "quality is not an option, it is a must."- Jeremy Mullaly, Skedulo engineering manager. The job of finding and fixing the product's bugs will not only prevent the potentially bad  in the user's experience,
      but it also help the company to reduce significant fanancial loss to fixable errors. Sometime, software bugs can lead to fatal situations in which the consequenses are irreversible. For instance,
      "Between 1985 and 1987, at least 5 patients were killed (and others critically injured) when a software-controlled radiation therapy system, the Therac-25, inadvertently administered massive
      overdoses of radiation — over 100 times the prescribed dose." <a href = "https://medium.com/swlh/when-software-kills-ab6f48a15825"> <i>When Software Kills</i></a>, Keri Savoca, Medium.com.
      <br>
      <br>
      Apparently, I have not pursued any sort of qualifications that make me eligible for an actual QA/QC engineer position at a company, I'm working towards the goals set ahead. Specifically, in addition
      to taking courses at RMIT, I am trained to work alongside with a QC team in Brisbane city and we are aiming stability for Skedulo Mobile Application in a foreseeable future.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since there is open source code for Automation Software Tests everywhere on the Internet, it is very accessible if we want to take advantage of that available precious information.
      Also, I'm currently have authorisation to look at internal test cases QC engineers at Skedulo wrote for the product, it is obviously a valuable opportunity to collect, both the technical
      and procedural knowledge.
    </p>
  </ol>
<h2> <b><u> Personal Profile</u></b></h2>
<h3> Meyer-Briggs Personality Test</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="Images\Screenshot personality test.png" width = 90% height = 90%>

<figcaption><i> Myer - Briggs Personality test result - Source: <a href ="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"> 16personalities.com</a> </i>  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  <p> The result of the test was not a surprise, I have done it many times in the past few years and the outcomes are always the same. Hence, personally, I take that as an
  advantage. Being able to think logically is apparently a desirable characteristic for a wannabe Programmer/Software Engineer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, having an INTP personality sometimes may hinder one's career progression in Technology, especially when that person work a business-dominant corporation rather than
  a tech-dominant one. Particularly, even though an INTP person usually has a excellent and innovative ideas, they sometimes struggle with not being capable of
  expressing their thoughts effectively via communication. Moreover, since they naturrally appear to be less energeted compared to some to other personality group,
  it may be an obstacle for collaborating in group.
  <br><br>
  The key solution for the problem is simple as practicing soft skills and expand the networks with people in the same categories as them. Yet that process potentially takes
  years to achieve.
</p>
<h3> Learning Style Test</h3>
<figure>
  <img src="Images\Screenshot (7).png" width = 90% height = 90%>

<figcaption><i> Learning Style quizz result - Source: <a href ="https://www.thoughtco.com/learning-style-quiz-4076781?quizResult=cb6da9af"> Thoughtco.com</a> </i>  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p> As a visual learner, this is an upside that supports one's journey to technology. The reasons include yet not limit to being able to convert one type of information to another,
being sensitive to visual information, being able to creating those really quickly, and the list goes on. This skill is critical in the field due to the enormous amount of information
processed every single moment. Owning the skill that handles information effectively is absolutely a priority.</p>
<br>
<p>
  Having this type of learning style may affect my contribution in a learning group in both a positive or negative way. Since I may need to visualise information in order to
  understand it thoroughly, it may differ me from the one who is more prone to logical thinking. However, a visual learner can break things down into small chunks and present
  it at a understandable way.
<br>
In order to improve my adaptability of collaborating in a group, a may need to communicate with others more frequently and get to know each other's backgrounds, personalities, and learning styles
to merge with each others's perspectives with mine and find out the common areas. In addition to that, testing out some other methods of learning is also a good way to see if they works for me. That
would as well help diversify my learning methodologies.
 </p>


<br>
</p>
<h3>Cognitive Ability Test </h3>
<br>
<figure>

<figcaption> <i> Cognitive Ability Abilities Mock Test - Source: <a href ="https://www.tests.com/practice/cognitive-abilities-practice-test"> Tests.com</a> </i> </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The test results encourages me to discover my logical thinking ability more since that is vital in Software development. Additionally find the way to elevate it.
  In fact, having a well-maintain cognitive ability does not hinder my cooperation in group, it, in fact, helps to construct a suitable workflow for a group projecte.
  It may as well support one's willpower to do the work as it is planned.
</p>

<h2>Project Idea: Social Platform for Coffee Lovers</h2>
<br>
  <p>Thoughout the history of humanity, coffee is one of the most well-known essential that people enjoy on daily basis. Its community comprises of a variety types of people, regardlesss of age,
    background, genders, ethnicity, etc. It is so crucial that it has been merging into our day without us being concious about having it, a coffee in the morning is a more like a cuklture than
    a personal routine. Therefore, the project I thought of is a platform that could connect coffee lovers in the world, where they can share their thoughts on their favourite cup
    of coffee, e.g rate it, or criticise a type of coffee that they do not enjoy. Moreover, this will be in the form of a social-meida-like application, so its main goal is a user-friendly,
    state-of-the-art sort of application, which would fit it into the current activities of the modern society really quickly.
   </p>
    <p>
    According to the currernt statistics, the percentage of American population who drink at least a cup of coffee per day is 64% (<a href =
    "https://www.foodandwine.com/news/americans-drinking-more-coffee-ever#:~:text=According%20to%20Reuters%2C%20a%20study,the%20highest%20percentage%20since%202012.">foodandwine.com  </a>).
    The statistics fluctuates from country to country yet it is always high. And the compound growth of the Coffee retail Market is 4.1% (<a href =
    "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191212005790/en/Global-Coffee-Shops-Market-Analysis-Trends-Forecasts#:~:text=The%20Coffee%20Shops%20market%20worldwide,a%20compounded%20growth%20of%204.1%25.&text=Poised%20to%20reach%20over%20US,significant%20momentum%20to%20global%20growth.">
    Global Coffee Shops Market Analysis, Trends, and Forecasts 2019-2025 - ResearchAndMarkets.com</a>), which can be considered quite high for a traditional industry, and the projected developmental speed does
    not seems to slow down in the future. Therefore, with the fact that there has a not been a popular social media application designed only for the coffeeholics, the is a potential share in the market
    for the application idea. Definitely, if the app was launched and maintain properly, it will profit
  </p>
    <p>
      Fundamentally, the bare bones of the platform will inherit from many other modern social media platforms and some other unique features will be developed alongside.
      Moreover, the process of development would put its focus on the user interface to set up a clean, minimal yet appealing display for the app. This is because most of the
      people who use social media platforms are later generation, obviously, the younger people are, the more of visual thinkers they are. An integrated, beautiful UI would
      be critical for an app to make it way to success in the society. Additionally, a reliable database for the app should also be constructed over time as the app should
      be able to provide users with sufficient information to maintain its impacts.

      <p>
      Initially, the idea of this niche social media platform came from a similar application called <a href ="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a>. It was created for craft beer lovers in all over the World.
       Despite the fact the platform aims for a very niche community, its revenue is up to $10m per anum (<a href="https://www.owler.com/company/untappd?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=2beb99df9527523e65dec38a0cbb58c1072bd056-1596157218-0-AZ9KoHtW6hpeuZXjtTLsiWTrbn7-9dZY8BAyQE2KhRkWDdpoxJFCwD6AsnukM37TPKd_AzF-UcZrfLEs4nfRHE3aVxFN5UJlZ1TmVwvex__8_A_jk3Js1BE0uIT4gd63lR4aAvTflCbsMKzlGvjXTPHlphY7YW7AJZni0yPlTiF5VNzcmFZvq6cK8JHkSRqHRXzuayKvW7dTb_7ylapFS3atOtSzAnbhfxEKX34o1JZowoIYo5NigXj2Nu3vYYjkPtm1OHA7wSC_F1GkWrABWM4dLAhjT4BufMrizd3ZV282OksLiD4TjKjvHxW_wfPeSCOPPWa6lz496hhtb9jv6xQqcBq83KzzRJCQspyvhIpB"> Owler.com</a>)
      in just 5 years since the day it was released. Based on that single example of social media for people of the same interest, we could possibly assume that another platform for an even bigger community would be profitable.
    </p>
    <b>In terms of technical aspect, the most crucial functionalities of the app would take after the features of the current trendy social media application, namely:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Ease of Connectivity</li>
      <li>Ability to Extensively Customize Individual Profiles</li>
      <li>Ability to Expand User Following</li>
      <li>Easy Integration With Other Social Media Platforms.</li>
      <li> Privacy and Security.</li>
      <li>Notification and News Feed</li>
      <br>
      <i> <a href="https://www.youngupstarts.com/2017/06/01/7-features-of-a-successful-social-media-app/"></a>Source: Youngupstarts.com  </i>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>The general workflow of the app would be:</b> (Expectations)
      <ol>
        <li>Open the app.</li>
        <li>The users can look up for the coffee location that they are currently at.</li>
        <li>Check in at the coffee shop with the specific type of coffee that the user is drinking.</li>
        <li>The users can take and attach a picture of the coffee</li>
        <li>The users are also permitted to rate the coffee and describe its unique flavours with available tags or by their own captions.</li>
        <li>Users can also tag a friend/partner who also have an account.</li>
        <li>The users can post their checkin at the location after customising it.</li>
        <li>The users would see the posts on their social feeds </li>
        <li>The users would also be able to see other's posts of whom they follow or connected</li>
      </ol>
     </p>
     <p>
       On User's Personal Profile, the app would display features and properties related to the number of coffee cups that user has had over a period of time.
       Moreover, it would as well calculate the average rating of the users, the types of coffee that they have been trying so far( e.g Flat White, Cold Brew, etc.),
       their networking with others in the app, and the list goes on.
     </p>
     <br>
     As time goes by, the app would be able to garther rating statistics from users and be able to rank the coffee shops, specialty coffee, etc.; from all over the world
     And recommend other users about the popular locations, drinks, information regarding that drink, previous checkin's reviews/comments while they are travelling to the
     area. Else, they could use the search engine to locate the good coffee shops that they want to go to in the future.
    <p>
     During the initial stage of the development, a minimal team should be enough for building the product. Since Python is not only a powerful yet user-friendly language, I have considered using
     it as the baseline for the product. There are some other useful external tools, libraries, frameworks that go with Python as well. Django or Flask are considered the most appropriate for
     the project since I want to commence with a web application. Later on, other languages and frameworks will be utilised for setting the app on other Operating Systems.
  </p>
  <p>In order to build the application, the technical work may not be very complicated at the beginning, thereby, basic knowledge of Web App development (both back-end and front-end), Testing, Data scienceand business
    would be sufficient. However, by the time the application has more users, it may get real complex and require thorough research and a certain amount of work put into it. The farther the product progresses,
    third-party services should be used for collaboration in a team, such services as <a href="Slack.com"> Slack</a>, <a href="Atlassian.com">Atlassian</a>. etc. will be neccesary.
  </p>
  <p>
     In the current context of modern society, provided the application would be developed properly and the progression advancces as expected. It is predictable that the application
     would be commercially monetary in a foreseeable future. One of the biggest factors that may contribute to yeilding a good outcome is the essential demand of sharing and connecting
     between individuals in modern society.Especially in an enormous community of coffee lovers, the app provide the service that can handle that need.
     And also, since the projection of rthe retail industry is very positive, collaboration between this product and those major retail brands will possibly
     reusult in financial mutual benefits for both parties, more generally, both industries.
